# BlockChain
This is a project made in collaboration with students from the business course.

This project contains three distinct elements:

## Demo for SmartContract
This part is a small blockchain demo that demonstrates how smart contracts are suposed to work. 

## Video for Demo
Our business group decided that they wanted a video demonstration of the demo, so this is also included inside. 

## Research for Blockchain Vulnerabilities
